# COMP598-FinalProject
This is a repository for our COMP 598 final

*json_files:* this is where we have the filtered data pulled from the subreddits

*tsv_files:* this is a folder of tsv files corresponding to the json files. we extracted the names / titles of each post to make it easier to read and work with

*tsv_files_annotated:* this is a copy of the previous folder, and this is where we'll be manually annotating the files

*coding_guide.txt:* this is the coding guide we came up with. we decided on 7 topics. it's not necessarily final, though
