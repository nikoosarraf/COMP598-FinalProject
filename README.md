# COMP598-FinalProject
### This is a repository for our COMP 598 final

**json_files:** this is where we have the filtered data pulled from the subreddits

**tsv_files:** this is a folder of tsv files corresponding to the json files. we extracted the names / titles of each post to make it easier to read and work with

**tsv_files_annotated:** this is a copy of the previous folder, and this is where we'll be manually annotating the files

**coding_guide.txt:** this is the coding guide we came up with. we decided on 7 topics. it's not necessarily final, though
